# LLM
Text to sequence of nodes LLM (based on the google Flan-T5-xl model)

Simple program to generate a sequence of nodes from a user prompt. It  offers two options:
1) Enter a text describing the functionality you wish to be performed. The program will then print a sequence of nodes implementing this functionality.
          
2) Enter a text describing the functionality you wish to be performed and a sequence of nodes in this format Sequence: Node1 Node2 Node3 ... .
   The program will then print a sequence of nodes implementing this functionality together with an evaluation of its accuracy based on your input sequence of nodes.


Program can be run by executing main.py

Executing the Dockerfile creates a Docker container running the program
